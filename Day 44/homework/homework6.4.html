                Foxes are small-to-medium-sized omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. They have a flattened skull; 
                upright, triangular ears; a pointed, slightly upturned snout; and a long, bushy tail ("brush").<br>
                Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true fox" group of genus Vulpes. Another 25 current or extinct species are sometimes 
                called foxes - they are part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes or an outlying group, which consists of the 
                bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.<br>
                Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with 
                about 47 recognized subspecies. The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has 
                contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs 
                of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various 
                parts of the New World.
