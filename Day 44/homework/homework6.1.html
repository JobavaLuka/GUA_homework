                    Armadillos  are New World placental mammals in the order Cingulata. They form part of the superorder Xenarthra, along with the 
                    anteaters and sloths. 21 extant species of armadillo have been described, some of which are distinguished by the number of 
                    bands on their armor. All species are native to the Americas, where they inhabit a variety of environments.<br>
                    Living armadillos are characterized by a leathery armor shell and long, sharp claws for digging. They have short legs, but can 
                    move quite quickly. The average length of an armadillo is about 75 cm (30 in), including its tail. The giant armadillo grows up 
                    to 150 cm (59 in) and weighs up to 54 kg (119 lb), while the pink fairy armadillo has a length of only 13-15 cm (5-6 in). When 
                    threatened by a predator, Tolypeutes species frequently roll up into a ball; they are the only species of armadillo capable of 
                    this.<br>
                    Recent genetic research has shown that the megafaunal glyptodonts (up to 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) tall with maximum body masses of 
                    around 2 tonnes), which became extinct around 12,000 years ago are true armadillos more closely related to all other living 
                    armadillos than to Dasypus (the long-nosed or naked-tailed armadillos). Armadillos are currently classified into two families, 
                    Dasypodidae, with Dasypus as the only living genus, and Chlamyphoridae, which contains all other living armadillos as well as 
                    the glyptodonts.
