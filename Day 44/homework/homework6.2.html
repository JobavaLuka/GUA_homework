                    The platypus, sometimes referred to as the duck-billed platypus, is a semiaquatic, egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern 
                    Australia, including Tasmania. The platypus is the sole living representative of its family Ornithorhynchidae and genus 
                    Ornithorhynchus, though a number of related species appear in the fossil record. Together with the four species of echidna, it 
                    is one of the five extant species of monotremes, mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. Like other 
                    monotremes, the platypus has a sense of electrolocation, which it uses to detect prey in water while its eyes, ears and 
                    nostrils are closed. It is one of the few species of venomous mammals, as the male platypus has a spur on each hind foot that 
                    delivers an extremely painful venom.<br>
                    The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed mammal at first baffled European naturalists. In 1799, 
                    the first scientists to examine a preserved platypus body judged it a fake made of several animals sewn together. The unique 
                    features of the platypus make it important in the study of evolutionary biology, and a recognisable and iconic symbol of 
                    Australia. It is culturally significant to several Aboriginal peoples, who also used to hunt it for food, and has appeared on 
                    stamps and currency.<br>
                    The platypus was hunted for its fur, but it has been a legally protected species in all states where it occurs since 1912. 
                    Captive breeding programs have had slight success, and it is vulnerable to pollution, bycatching and climate change. It is 
                    classified as a near-threatened species by the IUCN, but a November 2020 report has recommended that it be upgraded to 
                    threatened species under the federal EPBC Act, due to habitat destruction and declining numbers in all states.
