            <p>Volkswagen, which means “people's car” in German, has a unique and complex history that mirrors the 20th century's major events. 
            It was founded in 1937 in Germany under the direction of the German government, initially aiming to produce affordable vehicles for 
            the average citizen. The first model, designed by Ferdinand Porsche, later became known as the Volkswagen Beetle, which went on to 
            become one of the most iconic cars ever made. After World War II, Volkswagen was rebuilt under British control, and the Beetle 
            became a global symbol of practicality and charm. By the 1950s and 1960s, Volkswagen had firmly established itself in Europe and the 
            United States as a producer of reliable, affordable cars that appealed to everyday drivers. The company's advertisements in the 
            United States during this time were also groundbreaking, featuring minimalistic, humorous styles that made Volkswagen stand out in 
            the competitive American market. In the following decades, Volkswagen expanded its lineup with models like the Golf, Passat, and 
            Polo, which all became staples of European roads. The Golf, introduced in the 1970s, was especially significant—it replaced the 
            Beetle as Volkswagen's flagship model and defined the hatchback segment for generations. Over the years, Volkswagen acquired several 
            other major car brands, including Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley, Bugatti, and Škoda, forming one of the largest automotive 
            groups in the world. This expansion allowed Volkswagen to cover a wide range of markets, from affordable cars to luxury vehicles and 
            supercars. However, the company also faced challenges, most notably the 2015 “Dieselgate” emissions scandal, which revealed that 
            Volkswagen had used software to manipulate emissions tests on diesel vehicles. The scandal damaged the company's reputation and led 
            to billions of dollars in fines, but Volkswagen responded by shifting its focus toward electric vehicles and sustainability. Its ID 
            series, including the ID.3 and ID.4, represents Volkswagen's new direction in clean energy and digital innovation. Despite its past 
            controversies, Volkswagen remains a leader in global automotive production, with factories in dozens of countries and millions of 
            vehicles sold each year. The brand's combination of German engineering, practicality, and a focus on technological advancement 
            continues to shape its modern identity. Volkswagen's journey from the Beetle to the electric ID lineup shows a company that 
            constantly reinvents itself while maintaining its original mission of creating vehicles for everyone.</p>
