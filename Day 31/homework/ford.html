            <p>Ford is one of the most influential car manufacturers in history, not only for its vehicles but for the way it revolutionized 
            modern industry. Founded in 1903 by Henry Ford in Detroit, Michigan, the company transformed automobile production and accessibility 
            with the introduction of the assembly line and mass production techniques. The Ford Model T, launched in 1908, was the first car 
            affordable enough for ordinary Americans and quickly became a cultural icon. By improving manufacturing efficiency, Ford was able to 
            drastically reduce costs and make cars a part of everyday life. Henry Ford also introduced the concept of paying workers higher wages 
            so they could afford the products they made, a strategy that strengthened both the company and its workforce. Ford's innovations 
            extended beyond productionâ€”its approach to standardization, logistics, and labor shaped much of the industrial world in the early 
            20th century. In the decades that followed, Ford continued to expand globally and introduced numerous influential vehicles, such as 
            the Ford Mustang, F-Series trucks, and the Ford Explorer. The Mustang, in particular, became a symbol of American performance and 
            freedom during the 1960s and remains one of the most famous sports cars ever produced. The F-Series trucks have been the best-selling 
            vehicles in the United States for decades, known for their toughness and capability. Ford's influence also extended into motorsports, 
            with victories in events like Le Mans, solidifying its engineering credibility. The company has gone through various ups and downs, 
            including financial challenges and intense competition, but has always adapted through innovation and strategic change. In the 21st 
            century, Ford has embraced modernization with hybrid and electric vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 Lightning. The 
            company's push toward electrification reflects its commitment to staying relevant in an evolving market while balancing heritage and 
            innovation. Ford also invests heavily in autonomous driving and connected vehicle technologies, aiming to redefine mobility for 
            future generations. Despite economic fluctuations and changing customer demands, Ford remains deeply tied to American culture and 
            identity. Its reputation for durable trucks, iconic muscle cars, and practical family vehicles has kept it at the heart of the global 
            automotive industry. Ford's story is one of transformation, resilience, and innovation, spanning over a century of continuous 
            evolution from the Model T to the age of electric and smart vehicles, symbolizing the enduring power of progress and adaptability.</p>
