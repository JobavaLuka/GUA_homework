            <p>The proboscis monkey is a large, uniquely distinctive primate native to the mangrove forests, swamps, and riverine habitats of 
            Borneo in Southeast Asia. It is best known for its unusually large, pendulous nose, especially in males, which can reach up to 10 
            centimeters in length. This prominent nose is believed to play a role in attracting mates, amplifying vocalizations, and signaling 
            social status within groups. Adult males typically weigh between 16-22 kilograms, while females are smaller, averaging 7-12 
            kilograms. Their reddish-brown coat contrasts with their lighter underparts, and their long, partially webbed feet and hands make 
            them excellent swimmers, a rare trait among primates. Proboscis monkeys are primarily folivorous, feeding on leaves, seeds, and 
            unripe fruits, with occasional consumption of insects. They live in multi-male, multi-female groups or in all-male bachelor groups, 
            and exhibit strong social hierarchies. Communication involves honks, grunts, and other vocalizations that can travel across rivers 
            and dense vegetation. Unfortunately, habitat destruction from logging and palm oil plantations, combined with hunting pressures, has 
            led to their classification as endangered. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their mangrove and riverine habitats while 
            monitoring population health. Their iconic appearance, specialized diet, and semi-aquatic lifestyle make proboscis monkeys one of the 
            most unusual and charismatic primates in the world.</p>

            <h2 id="spider">Spider monkey</h2>
            <img src="Spider.webp" width="700" height="500">
            <p>Spider monkeys are agile, long-limbed primates found throughout Central and South American tropical forests. Named for their 
            spider-like appearance, their elongated limbs and prehensile tails allow them to swing gracefully through the forest canopy with 
            remarkable speed and precision, a locomotion method called brachiation. Their prehensile tail is especially remarkable, functioning 
            almost like a fifth limb, complete with a sensitive tactile pad at the tip for grasping branches. Spider monkeys are primarily 
            frugivorous, relying heavily on ripe fruits, but they also consume leaves, flowers, and seeds. They live in highly social, 
            fission-fusion societies, meaning large groups frequently split into smaller subgroups to forage, then reunite later. Adult spider 
            monkeys usually weigh between 6-9 kilograms and have slender bodies covered in black, brown, or reddish fur. They communicate through 
            vocalizations, body postures, and facial expressions, signaling alarm, play, or social interaction. Their intelligence and 
            problem-solving skills are notable, and they exhibit behaviors such as tool use and cooperative grooming. Habitat loss due to 
            deforestation, hunting, and the pet trade has made many spider monkey species vulnerable or endangered. Conservation efforts 
            emphasize protecting continuous forest habitats, creating wildlife corridors, and promoting sustainable land-use practices. Their 
            acrobatic movements, social complexity, and expressive faces make spider monkeys one of the most fascinating primates in the 
            Neotropics.</p>

            <h2 id="ABH">Amazon black howler monkey</h2>
            <img src="AmazonBlackHowler.jpg" width="700" height="500">
            <p>The Amazon black howler monkey, also known as the black howler, is a large New World primate native to the forests of South 
            America, particularly the Amazon Basin and surrounding regions. These monkeys are famous for their deep, resonant howls, which can 
            carry for up to three kilometers through dense forests. These vocalizations help establish territory boundaries, coordinate group 
            movements, and maintain social cohesion. Black howlers are among the heaviest and most robust of the howler monkey species, with 
            adult males weighing up to 10 kilograms, slightly smaller than females. Their black fur, combined with a prehensile tail and strong 
            limbs, makes them adept at navigating the canopy. Their diet consists primarily of leaves, fruits, flowers, and nuts, making them 
            primarily folivorous but also opportunistically frugivorous. They typically live in small, cohesive groups ranging from 6-15 
            individuals, with a dominant male leading the group. Social bonds are reinforced through grooming and vocal interactions. Amazon 
            black howlers are relatively sedentary compared to other primates, conserving energy to digest their leafy diet. Threats include 
            deforestation, hunting, and habitat fragmentation, which have caused local population declines. Despite this, their adaptability to 
            secondary forests has helped some populations persist. Their iconic, thunderous calls, gentle demeanor, and strong family bonds make 
            the black howler a distinctive and easily recognizable primate of South America's tropical forests.</p>

            <h2 id="mandrill">Mandrill monkey</h2>
            <img src="Mandrill.jpg" width="700" height="500">
            <p>The mandrill is a large and visually striking primate native to the rainforests of central West Africa, particularly Gabon, 
            Cameroon, and Congo. It is famous for its vivid facial coloration: bright blue ridges flanking a red nose, complemented by red and 
            blue rump skin, especially pronounced in adult males. These colors signal social status, health, and reproductive fitness. Mandrills 
            are among the largest monkeys, with adult males weighing up to 35 kilograms and females about half that weight. Their diet is 
            omnivorous, consisting of fruits, seeds, leaves, insects, and occasionally small vertebrates. Mandrills live in highly social and 
            complex groups called “hordes,” which can number over 100 individuals, though they forage in smaller subgroups during the day. 
            Social hierarchy is critical, with dominant males controlling access to females and leading group movements. Communication includes 
            vocalizations, facial expressions, and body postures, such as the intimidating “yawn” to show canine teeth. Mandrills are terrestrial 
            but also climb trees for foraging and sleeping. Despite their popularity in zoos and cultural awareness, they face threats from 
            hunting for bushmeat and habitat destruction, making them vulnerable in the wild. Their incredible coloration, complex social 
            behavior, and combination of intelligence and physical strength make mandrills one of the most spectacular and fascinating monkeys on 
            Earth.</p>

            <h2 id="angolac">Angola colobus monkey</h2>
            <img src="AngolaColobus.webp" width="700" height="500">
            <p>The Angola colobus, or black-and-white colobus monkey, is an elegant primate native to the forests and woodlands of central and 
            eastern Africa, including Angola, Kenya, and Tanzania. Its most striking feature is its long, flowing black fur contrasted with white 
            facial markings, a white tail tip, and white fringes on the shoulders and sides, giving it a tuxedo-like appearance. Adults typically 
            weigh between 9-14 kilograms, with males slightly larger than females. Angola colobus monkeys are predominantly folivorous, feeding 
            on leaves, seeds, and fruits, and they have specialized multi-chambered stomachs to ferment tough plant material efficiently. They 
            live in social groups ranging from 3-15 individuals, often consisting of one dominant male, several females, and their offspring. 
            Communication involves soft vocalizations, alarm calls, and visual cues like tail movements and body posture. These monkeys are 
            primarily arboreal, rarely descending to the ground, and are adept at leaping between tree branches. Predators include large birds of 
            prey, leopards, and humans in some areas. Habitat destruction and hunting for their striking fur threaten some populations. Angola 
            colobus monkeys play a crucial ecological role by aiding seed dispersal and maintaining forest health. Their striking coloration, 
            gentle social structure, and graceful arboreal movements make them a visually captivating and ecologically important primate.</p>
