    <h1>What is Nu-metal?</h1>
    <p>Nu-metal is a music genre that fuses heavy metal with elements of hip-hop, grunge, and alternative rock. Emerging in the late 1990s, it features downtuned guitars, aggressive vocals, rapped verses, and DJ effects. Bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Linkin Park popularized the style with angst-driven lyrics and energetic performances.</p>
