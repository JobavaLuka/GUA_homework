            <p>Toyota is one of the most recognized and respected automobile manufacturers in the world, known for its reliability, innovation, 
            and long-term commitment to quality. Founded in 1937 by Kiichiro Toyoda in Japan, Toyota started as a division of Toyoda Automatic 
            Loom Works, focusing on creating cars that could compete with Western brands. In its early years, Toyota faced many challenges, 
            including Japan's limited resources before and after World War II, but the company persisted through innovation and efficiency. The 
            introduction of the Toyota Production System, a revolutionary manufacturing approach emphasizing lean production and just-in-time 
            delivery, became one of the most influential ideas in modern industry. This system reduced waste and increased productivity, shaping 
            not only Toyota's identity but also setting a global standard for automotive manufacturing. Toyota's rise to international success 
            began in the 1950s and 1960s when it started exporting vehicles to markets like the United States. The company quickly gained a 
            reputation for creating affordable, durable, and fuel-efficient cars. Models like the Corolla, introduced in 1966, became legendary 
            for their simplicity and longevity, eventually becoming one of the best-selling cars in history. Toyota's focus on quality control 
            and continuous improvement, known as “kaizen,” ensured that its vehicles remained dependable across generations. In the 1990s and 
            2000s, Toyota became a leader in environmental technology with the introduction of the Prius, the world's first mass-produced hybrid 
            car. This move showed Toyota's forward-thinking approach to sustainability and efficiency long before electric cars became 
            mainstream. The company continued to innovate with hydrogen fuel cell vehicles like the Mirai and hybrid versions of nearly all its 
            models. Today, Toyota operates globally, producing millions of vehicles per year in factories spread across multiple continents. It 
            has a diverse lineup ranging from compact cars and sedans to SUVs, trucks, and luxury models under its Lexus division. Toyota is also 
            heavily investing in autonomous driving technology, artificial intelligence, and solid-state batteries. The company's philosophy 
            remains centered on respect for people and continuous improvement. It has also shown remarkable resilience in times of crisis, such 
            as recovering quickly from the 2011 Japan earthquake and navigating global supply chain issues. Toyota's strong reputation for 
            reliability, paired with its efforts to adapt to the rapidly changing automotive landscape, ensures its position as one of the most 
            trusted and innovative car brands in the world.</p>
